# img-slider

A simple image slider build to learn Elm. Currently a work in progress. I hope
to get it to a similar stage as one of my other projects
[lightweight-slier](https://github.com/lukakerr/lightweight-slider) sometime in
the future.

### Build

Building is simple

```bash
$ elm make src/Slider.elm
$ open index.html
```
