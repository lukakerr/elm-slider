# elm-slider

A simple image slider build to learn Elm. Currently a work in progress. I hope
to get it to a similar stage as one of my other projects
[lightweight-slider](https://github.com/lukakerr/lightweight-slider) sometime in
the future.

### Build

Building is simple

```bash
$ elm make src/Slider.elm
$ open index.html
```

> Note: there are 3 images (1.jpg, 2.jpg, 3.jpg) under `.gitignore`, you will
> have to create these manually inside an `/img` folder to see the images
